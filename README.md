# Project-1--Wiki
Project 1 : Wiki CS50W
I designed a Wikipedia - like online encyclopedia. 
Implementation of this program involved creating an entry page which illustrates the contents of an entry. 
Index which contains the names of all pages in the encyclopedia.
A search function which lets the User search for an entry.
New page which alows the user to create a new entry as well as edit the entry.
Finally, a random page allows the user to choose to see a random entry.
